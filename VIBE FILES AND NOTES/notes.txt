it seems possibe for me to simplify the control input for wheeled control by using tendons might help with rl,
i could make it so rl can control the tendon "gains" for forward and turning

<motor> control might be a good option to use instead of velocity becase it allows for realistic torque controll and cant cheat

how joint position is controlled is by modifying default position of the joint.
for wheel we need to check if it's doing this or now if so the robot will never stand still because even at 0 input there will still be a controll signal

check what input range the ppo policy is able to output
-> yup there is a limit set by joint range and #Colab_wheeled.ipynb, line 811 policy_config.action_scale = 0.75

footsite used in enviroment to calculate foot slip and airtime
CLOSER ATTENTION TO THAT WHEN LOOKING AT REWARDS
